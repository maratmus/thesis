  abstract      = {Context. The advent of deep multiwavelength extragalactic surveys has led to the necessity for advanced and fast methods for photometric analysis. In fact, codes which allow analyses of the same regions of the sky observed at different wavelengths and resolutions are becoming essential to thoroughly exploit current and future data. In this context, a key issue is the confusion (i.e. blending) of sources in low-resolution images. <BR /> Aims: We present t-phot, a publicly available software package developed within the astrodeep project. t-phot is aimed at extracting accurate photometry from low-resolution images, where the blending of sources can be a serious problem for the accurate and unbiased measurement of fluxes and colours. <BR /> Methods: t-phot can be considered as the next generation to tfit, providing significant improvements over and above it and other similar codes (e.g. convphot). t-phot gathers data from a high-resolution image of a region of the sky, and uses this information (source positions and morphologies) to obtain priors for the photometric analysis of the lower resolution image of the same field. t-phot can handle different types of datasets as input priors, namely i) a list of objects that will be used to obtain cutouts from the real high-resolution image; ii) a set of analytical models (as .fits stamps); iii) a list of unresolved, point-like sources, useful for example for far-infrared (FIR) wavelength domains. <BR /> Results: By means of simulations and analysis of real datasets, we show that t-phot yields accurate estimations of fluxes within the intrinsic uncertainties of the method, when systematic errors are taken into account (which can be done thanks to a flagging code given in the output). t-phot is many times faster than similar codes like tfit and convphot (up to hundreds, depending on the problem and the method adopted), whilst at the same time being more robust and more versatile. This makes it an excellent choice for the analysis of large datasets. When used with the same parameter sets as for tfit it yields almost identical results (although in a much shorter time); in addition we show how the use of different settings and methods significantly enhances the performance. <BR /> Conclusions: t-phot proves to be a state-of-the-art tool for multiwavelength optical to far-infrared image photometry. Given its versatility and robustness, t-phot can be considered the preferred choice for combined photometric analysis of current and forthcoming extragalactic imaging surveys.  t-phot is publicly available for downloading from <A href=``http://www.astrodeep.eu/t-phot/''>http://www.astrodeep.eu/t-phot/</A>},

  abstract = {The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) has been used by astronomers for over 30 years as a data interchange and archiving format; FITS files are now handled by a wide range of astronomical software packages. Since the FITS format definition document (the {\ldquo}standard{\rdquo}) was last printed in this journal in 2001, several new features have been developed and standardized, notably support for 64-bit integers in images and tables, variable-length arrays in tables, and new world coordinate system conventions which provide a mapping from an element in a data array to a physical coordinate on the sky or within a spectrum. The FITS Working Group of the International Astronomical Union has therefore produced this new version 3.0 of the FITS standard, which is provided here in its entirety. In addition to describing the new features in FITS, numerous editorial changes were made to the previous version to clarify and reorganize many of the sections. Also included are some appendices which are not formally part of the standard. The FITS standard is likely to undergo further evolution, in which case the latest version may be found on the FITS Support Office Web site at $\lt$ext-link ext-link-type=``uri'' xlink:href=``http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/''$\gt$http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/$\lt$/ext-link$\gt$, which also provides many links to FITS-related resources.},

  abstract = {An iterative technique is described for generating estimates to the solutions of rectification and deconvolution problems in statistical astronomy. The technique, which derives from Bayes' theorem on conditional probabili- ties, conserves the constraints on frequency distributions (i.e., normalization and non-negativeness) and, at each iteration, increases the likelihood of the observed sample. The behavior of the technique is explored by applying it to roblems whose solutions are known in the limit of infinite sample size, and excellent results are obtained after a few iterations. The astronomical use of the technique is illustrated by applying it to the problem of rectifying distributions of v sin i for aspect effect; calculations are also reported illustrating the technique's possible use for correcting radio-astronomical observations for beam-smoothing. Application to the problem of obtaining unbiased, smoothed histograms is also suggested.},

  abstract      = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite observed the full sky in four mid-infrared bands in the 2.8-28 {$\mu$}m range. The primary mission was completed in 2010. The WISE team has done a superb job of producing a series of high-quality, well-documented, complete data releases in a timely manner. However, the ``Atlas Image'' coadds that are part of the recent AllWISE and previous data releases were intentionally blurred. Convolving the images by the point-spread function while coadding results in ``matched-filtered'' images that are close to optimal for detecting isolated point sources. But these matched-filtered images are sub-optimal or inappropriate for other purposes. For example, we are photometering the WISE images at the locations of sources detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through forward modeling, and this blurring decreases the available signal-to-noise by effectively broadening the point-spread function. This paper presents a new set of coadds of the WISE images that have not been blurred. These images retain the intrinsic resolution of the data and are appropriate for photometry preserving the available signal-to-noise. Users should be cautioned, however, that the W3- and W4-band coadds contain artifacts around large, bright structures (large galaxies, dusty nebulae, etc.); eliminating these artifacts is the subject of ongoing work. These new coadds, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at <A href=``http://unwise.me''>http://unwise.me</A>.},

Stripe 82 covers an area of \~{}300 deg$^{2}$ on the celestial equator, and has been repeatedly scanned 70-90 times in the ugriz bands by the SDSS imaging survey. By making use of all available data in the SDSS archive, our co-added images are optimized for depth. Input single-epoch frames were properly processed and weighted based on seeing, sky transparency, and background noise before co-addition. The resultant products are co-added science images and their associated weight images that record relative weights at individual pixels. The depths of the co-adds, measured as the 5{$\sigma$} detection limits of the aperture (3.''2 diameter) magnitudes for point sources, are roughly 23.9, 25.1, 24.6, 24.1, and 22.8 AB magnitudes in the five bands, respectively. They are 1.9-2.2 mag deeper than the best SDSS single-epoch data. The co-added images have good image quality, with an average point-spread function FWHM of \~{}1'' in the r, i, and z bands. We also release object catalogs that were made with SExtractor. These co-added products have many potential uses for studies of galaxies, quasars, and Galactic structure. We further present and release near-IR J-band images that cover \~{}90 deg$^{2}$ of Stripe 82.

  abstract      = {Fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is an almost universally used technique that has matured significantly in the last decade. Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, finer details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (http://sedfitting.org), where the community can access and change the text. The intention is to expand the text and keep it up to date over the coming years.},

The HETDEX blind R {\tilde} 800 spectroscopy will produce {\tilde}200,000 redshifts from the Ly{$\alpha$} emission for galaxies in the range 1.9 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3.5, and an additional {\tilde}200,000 redshifts from the [O II] emission for galaxies at z $\lt$ 0.5. When combined with deep ugriz images from the Dark Energy Camera, K-band images from NEWFIRM, and other ancillary data, the IRAC photometry from Spitzer will enable a broad range of scientific studies of the relationship between structure formation, galaxy stellar mass, halo mass, the presence of active galactic nuclei, and environment over a co-moving volume of {\tilde}0.5 Gpc$^{3}$ at 1.9 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3.5. Here, we discuss the properties of the SHELA IRAC data set, including the data acquisition, reduction, validation, and source catalogs. Our tests show that the images and catalogs are 80\% (50\%) complete to limiting magnitudes of 22.0 (22.6) AB mag in the detection image, which is constructed from the weighted sum of the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 {$\mu$}m images. The catalogs reach limiting sensitivities of 1.1 {$\mu$}Jy at both 3.6 and 4.5 {$\mu$}m (1{$\sigma$}, for R = 2{\Prime} circular apertures). As a demonstration of the science, we present IRAC number counts, examples of highly temporally variable sources, and galaxy surface density profiles of rich galaxy clusters. In the spirit of the Spitzer Exploratory programs, we provide all of the images and catalogs as part of the publication.},

The catalog is built on three pillars of survey data: the SDSS Stripe 82 Coadd photometry which reaches r-band magnitudes of {\tilde}23.5 AB, Y JHK photometry at depths of 20th magnitude (AB) from the UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey Large Area Survey, and over 70,000 spectroscopic galaxy redshifts from the SDSS-I/II and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We describe the catalog construction and verification, the production of 9-band matched aperture photometry, tests of existing and newly estimated photometric redshifts required to supplement spectroscopic redshifts for 55\% of the $\{$log$\}$$\{$M$\}$$_{*}$/$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }${\gsim} 11.2 sample, and geometric masking. We provide near-IR based stellar mass estimates and compare these to previous estimates. All catalog products are made publicly available. The s82-mgc not only addresses previous statistical limitations in high-mass galaxy evolution studies, but also begins tackling inherent data challenges in the coming era of wide-field imaging surveys.},

  abstract      = {We present the SWIRE Photometric Redshift Catalogue 1025119 redshifts of unprecedented reliability and of accuracy comparable with or better than previous work. Our methodology is based on fixed galaxy and quasi-stellar object templates applied to data at 0.36-4.5 {$\mu$}m, and on a set of four infrared emission templates fitted to infrared excess data at 3.6-170 {$\mu$}m. The galaxy templates are initially empirical, but are given greater physical validity by fitting star formation histories to them, which also allows us to estimate stellar masses. The code involves two passes through the data, to try to optimize recognition of active galactic nucleus (AGN) dust tori. A few carefully justified priors are used and are the key to supression of outliers. Extinction, A$_{V}$, is allowed as a free parameter. The full reduced {$\chi$}$^{2}$$_{ν}$ (z) distribution is given for each source, so the full error distribution can be used, and aliases investigated.  We use a set of 5982 spectroscopic redshifts, taken from the literature and from our own spectroscopic surveys, to analyse the performance of our method as a function of the number of photometric bands used in the solution and the reduced {$\chi$}$^{2}$$_{ν}$. For seven photometric bands (5 optical + 3.6, 4.5 {$\mu$}m), the rms value of (z$_{phot}$ - z$_{spec}$)/(1 + z$_{spec}$) is 3.5 per cent, and the percentage of catastrophic outliers [defined as $\gt$15 per cent error in (1 + z)], is \~{}1 per cent. These rms values are comparable with the best achieved in other studies, and the outlier fraction is significantly better. The inclusion of the 3.6- and 4.5-{$\mu$}m IRAC bands is crucial in supression of outliers.  We discuss the redshift distributions at 3.6 and 24 {$\mu$}m. In individual fields, structure in the redshift distribution corresponds to clusters which can be seen in the spectroscopic redshift distribution, so the photometric redshifts are a powerful tool for large-scale structure studies. 10 per cent of sources in the SWIRE photometric redshift catalogue have z $\gt$ 2, and 4 per cent have z $\gt$ 3, so this catalogue is a huge resource for high-redshift galaxies.  A key parameter for understanding the evolutionary status of infrared galaxies is L$_{ir}$/L$_{opt}$. For cirrus galaxies this is a measure of the mean extinction in the interstellar medium of the galaxy. There is a population of ultraluminous galaxies with cool dust and we have shown SEDs for some of the reliable examples. For starbursts, we estimate the specific star formation rate, {\phis}$_{*}$/M$_{*}$. Although the very highest values of this ratio tend to be associated with Arp220 starbursts, by no means all ultraluminous galaxies are. We discuss an interesting population of galaxies with elliptical-like spectral energy distributions in the optical and luminous starbursts in the infrared.  For dust tori around type 1 AGN, L$_{tor}$/L$_{opt}$ is a measure of the torus covering factor and we deduce a mean covering factor of 40 per cent.  Our infrared templates also allow us to estimate dust masses for all galaxies with an infrared excess.},

Modern photometric redshift (photo-z) algorithms use galaxy magnitudes, or colours, that are obtained through multiband imaging to produce a probability density function (PDF) for each galaxy in the map. We used simulated data to study the effect of using different photo-z estimators to assign galaxies to redshift bins in order to compare their effects on angular clustering and galaxy bias measurements. We found that if we use the entire PDF, rather than a single-point (mean or mode) estimate, the deviations are less biased, especially when using narrow redshift bins. When the redshift bin widths are {$\Delta$}z = 0.1, the use of the entire PDF reduces the typical measurement bias from 5 per cent, when using single point estimates, to 3 per cent.},

  abstract      = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or are only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semianalytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q$_{z}$, which provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not ``trained'' on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public data sets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields, we find a 1 {$\sigma$} scatter in {$\Delta$} z/(1 + z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

Direct evidence on the value of n is found in the relative distribution, perpendicular to the galactic plane, of gas and young objects. For various values of n, computations were made of the initial luminosity function, the rate of star formation, the exchange of gas between stars and interstellar medium, the number of white dwarfs and their luminosity function, and the abundance of helium. It is concluded, from a comparison of the results with observational data, that n is around 2. The present rate of star formation, then, is five times slower than the average rate. The interstellar gas, of which the surface density on the galactic plane was taken to be 11 per square parsec, loses 1.4 O/pc2 per 10 years by the formation of stars but gains about one-third of this by ejection of gas from evolving stars. The present helium abundance of the interstellar gas may be explained if a star has burned, on the average, 53 per cent of its original hydrogen into helium at the time that ejection takes place. The ejected material was assumed to have a composition equal to the average composition of the star. The effect of star formation on the gas density in the galactic system and other galaxies is briefly discussed.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

Star color-color, number counts, and PSF size versus modeled size plots show that the modeling of the PSF is good enough for precision five-band photometry. Structure in the PSF model versus magnitude plot indicates minor PSF modeling errors, leading to misclassification of stars as galaxies, as verified using VVDS spectroscopy.

WISE is achieving 5{$\sigma$} point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 {$\mu$}m. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6farcs1, 6farcs4, 6farcs5, and 12farcs0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 {$\mu$}m, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0farcs15.},

  abstract = {The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) consists of a spacecraft and a liquid helium cryostat that contains a cooled IR telescope. The telescope's focal plane assembly is cooled to less than 3 K, and contains 62 IR detectors in the survey array which are arranged so that every source crossing the field of view can be seen by at least two detectors in each of four wavelength bands. The satellite was launched into a 900 km-altitude near-polar orbit, and its cryogenic helium supply was exhausted on November 22, 1983. By mission's end, 72 percent of the sky had been observed with three or more hours-confirming scans, and 95 percent with two or more hours-confirming scans. About 2000 stars detected at 12 and 25 microns early in the mission, and identified in the SAO (1966) catalog, have a positional uncertainty ellipse whose axes are 45 x 9 arcsec for an hours-confirmed source.},

The instrument, a ten-band cryogenic absolute photometer and three-band polarimeter with a 0.7 degree(s) beam and a wavelength range from 1 - 240 micrometers , scans the sky redundantly and samples half the sky each day. During the ten month lifetime of the cryogen, the instrument achieved a nominal sensitivity on the sky of 10$^{-9}$ W/m$^{2}$/sr at most wavelengths, or approximately 1\% of the natural background at wavelengths where the sky is very luminous. The short wavelength bands from 1 - 5 micrometers continue to operate after exhaustion of the cryogen, although at reduced sensitivity.

  abstract = {Infrared surveys have discovered a significant population of bright (K $\lt$\~{} 19) extremely red (R - K \~{}$\gt$ 6) objects. Little is known about the properties of these objects on account of their optical faintness (R \~{}$\gt$ 24). Here we report deep infrared imaging and spectroscopy of one of the extremely red objects (EROs) discovered by Hu {\amp} Ridgway in the field of the z = 3.79 quasar PC 1643+4631A. The infrared images were obtained in 0.5`` seeing and show that the object (denoted HR 10) is not a dynamically relaxed elliptical galaxy dominated by an old stellar population as was previously suspected, but instead has an asymmetric morphology suggestive of either a disk or an interacting system. The infrared spectrum of HR 10 shows a single, possibly broad emission feature at 1.60 microns, which we identify as H{$\alpha$} + [N II] at z = 1.44. The luminosity and width of this emission line indicates either intense star formation (\~{}20 h\^{}-2\^{} M\_sun\_ yr\^{}-1\^{}) or the presence of an active nucleus. Based on the rest frame UV-optical spectral energy distribution, the luminosity of HR 10 is estimated to be 3-8 L\^{}*\^{}. The colors of HR 10 are unusually red for a galaxy (at z = 1.44 the age of HR 10 is at most 2-8 Gyr depending on cosmology) and indicate that HR 10 is dusty. HR 10 is detected weakly at radio wavelengths; this is consistent with either the starburst or active galactic nucleus hypothesis. If HR 10 is a typical representative of its class, EROs are numerous and represent a significant component of the luminous objects in the universe at z \~{} 1.5.},

  abstract = {We have obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 24 sources from a sample of bright, K-selected extremely red objects (EROs) using the Keck I Telescope. These EROs have high-resolution morphologies from the Hubble Space Telescope and were selected with a median K$_{s}$ magnitude of 18.7 and F814W-K$_{s}$$\gt$4 mag (Yan {\amp} Thompson 2003). Among the 24 redshifts, the majority (92\%) are at 0.9$\lt$z$\lt$1.5. We derived the rest-frame J-band luminosity function at z$_{median}$=1.14. Our result suggests that the luminosity evolution between bright EROs at z\~{}1 and the present-day greater than L* massive galaxies is at most about 0.7 mag. Combining the morphologies and deep spectroscopy revealed that the 24 EROs have the following properties: (1) Eighty-six percent of the spectra have absorption features from old stars, suggesting that the dominant stellar populations seen in the rest-frame UV are old stars. Fifty percent of the sources have pure absorption lines, while the remaining 50\% have emission lines, indicating recent star formation. We conclude that the color criterion for EROs is very effective in selecting old stellar populations at z\~{}1, and a large fraction of these systems with prominent old stellar populations also have recent star formation. (2) The 12 emission-line systems have the same number of disk and bulge galaxies as in the remaining 12 pure absorption-line systems. We conclude that spectral classes do not have a simple, direct correspondence with morphological types. (3) Three EROs could be isolated, pure passively evolving early-type galaxies at z\~{}1. This implies that only a small fraction (10\%-15\%) of early-type galaxies are formed in a rapid burst of star formation at high redshifts and evolved passively since then. (4) Three EROs have very red continua and pure emission-line spectra. Their redshifts and star formation rates are similar to that of HR 10. These three sources are potential candidates for dusty starbursts. (5) We identified three active galactic nuclei (13\%), which is consistent with what has been found by deep Chandra observations.},

  abstract = {The WIYN High Resolution Infrared Camera (WHIRC) is a high-resolution near-infrared imager (0.8-2.5 {$\mu$}m) designed to produce superb images over a moderate (3.3$^{‧}$ {\times} 3.4$^{‧}$) field of view on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. It takes scientific advantage of the excellent image quality produced by the telescope and its image stabilization subsystem, the WIYN Tip-Tilt Module (WTTM), which is located on one of two Nasmyth ports. WHIRC mounts to WTTM and reimages the WTTM focal plane to a plate scale of 0.1{\Prime} pixel$^{-1}$ at the WHIRC detector. Its straight-through optical path makes for a compact, very low mass, instrument{\mdash}a necessity, given the stringent moment-loading requirement at the WTTM interface. The WHIRC optical path consists of a vacuum window, a five-element collimator, a dual filter wheel, a five-element achromatic camera, and a 2k$^{2}$ Raytheon VIRGO mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) detector. A novel all-aluminum lens cell design is used to achieve 13 {$\mu$}m lens centering tolerances between ambient and the 77 K operating temperature. A suite of 13 filters facilitates broadband (J, H, and K$_{s}$) imaging, as well as narrowband imaging tailored to a variety of astronomical investigations. The imaging performance of WHIRC is excellent. Irrespective of seeing, the telescope, and WTTM, WHIRC delivers 0.13{\Prime}, 0.11{\Prime}, and 0.08{\Prime} FWHM images in J, H, and K$_{s}$, respectively. On sky, the imaging is equally impressive yielding images as good as {\tilde}0.25 FWHM in K$_{s}$. In this article we describe the WHIRC design in detail and present the predicted and measured instrument performance.},

  abstract      = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic {\ldquo}dark ages{\rdquo} to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z{\ap}1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than {\tilde}1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

  abstract      = {Weak lensing by large-scale structure is an invaluable cosmological tool given that most of the energy density of the concordance cosmology is invisible. Several large ground-based imaging surveys will attempt to measure this effect over the coming decade, but reliable control of the spurious lensing signal introduced by atmospheric turbulence and telescope optics remains a challenging problem. We address this challenge with a demonstration that point spread function (PSF) effects on measured galaxy shapes in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) can be corrected with existing analysis techniques. In this work, we co-add existing SDSS imaging on the equatorial stripe in order to build a data set with the statistical power to measure cosmic shear, while using a rounding kernel method to null out the effects of the anisotropic PSF. We build a galaxy catalogue from the combined imaging, characterize its photometric properties and show that the spurious shear remaining in this catalogue after the PSF correction is negligible compared to the expected cosmic shear signal. We identify a new source of systematic error in the shear-shear autocorrelations arising from selection biases related to masking. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which this method is expected to be useful for upcoming ground-based surveys that have lensing as one of the science goals, and identify the systematic errors that can reduce its efficacy.},

(2) It can handle complex masks with varying depth. (3) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure studies. (4) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P(z). (5) Similarly, clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies, each with corresponding centering probabilities.

(7) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance, the richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies, and the completeness and purity of the corresponding catalogs are superb.

The median value for |{$\Delta$}z|/(1 + z) for the full sample is 0.006. The incidence of projection effects is low ($\lt$=5\%).

The redMaPPer cluster finding algorithm treats this problem probabilistically, focusing exclusively on the red galaxy population. Here, we utilize Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Galaxy And Mass Assembly spectroscopic membership rates to validate the redMaPPer membership probability estimates for clusters with z {\isin} [0.1, 0.3]. We find small - but correctable - biases, sourced by three different systematics. The first two were expected a priori, namely blue cluster galaxies and correlated structure along the line of sight. The third systematic is new: the redMaPPer template fitting exhibits a non-trivial dependence on photometric noise, which biases the original redMaPPer probabilities when utilizing noisy data. After correcting for these effects, we find exquisite agreement ({\ap}1 per cent) between the photometric probability estimates and the spectroscopic membership rates, demonstrating that we can robustly recover cluster membership estimates from photometric data alone. As a byproduct of our analysis we find that on average unavoidable projection effects from correlated structure contribute {\ap}6 per cent of the richness of a redMaPPer galaxy cluster.

  abstract      = {We present a determination of the effects of including galaxy morphological parameters in photometric redshift estimation with an artificial neural network method. Neural networks, which recognize patterns in the information content of data in an unbiased way, can be a useful estimator of the additional information contained in extra parameters, such as those describing morphology, if the input data are treated on an equal footing. We use imaging and five band photometric magnitudes from the All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS). It is shown that certain principal components of the morphology information are correlated with galaxy type. However, we find that for the data used the inclusion of morphological information does not have a statistically significant benefit for photometric redshift estimation with the techniques employed here. The inclusion of these parameters may result in a tradeoff between extra information and additional noise, with the additional noise becoming more dominant as more parameters are added.},

  abstract      = {Photometric redshift estimation is becoming an increasingly important technique, although the currently existing methods present several shortcomings which hinder their application.  Most of those drawbacks are efficiently eliminated when Bayesian probability is consistently applied to this problem. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization allows the inclusion of valuable information, e.g. the redshift distributions or the galaxy type mix, which is often ignored by other methods. In those cases when the a priori information is insufficient, it is shown how to `calibrate' the prior distributions, using even the data under consideration. There is an excellent agreement between the 108 HDF spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error Delta z/(1+z\_spec) = 0.08 up to z$\lt$6 and no systematic biases nor outliers. The results obtained are more reliable than those of standard techniques even when the latter include near-IR colors. The Bayesian formalism developed here can be generalized to deal with a wide range of problems which make use of photometric redshifts, e.g. the estimation of individual galaxy characteristics as the metallicity, dust content, etc., or the study of galaxy evolution and the cosmological parameters from large multicolor surveys. Finally, using Bayesian probability it is possible to develop an integrated statistical method for cluster mass reconstruction which simultaneously considers the information provided by gravitational lensing and photometric redshifts.},

  abstract = {The conventional method of measuring red- shifts of remote galaxies by photographing their spectra has yielded firm results out to 60,000 km/sec, or 0.2 C. This corresponds, for the brighter members of a typical cluster of galaxies, to about 17th or i8th photovisual magnitude. Beyond this, spectrographic observations become difficult. The limit of the method is set not so much by the length of exposure required as by the presence of the spectrum of the night sky against which the superimposed spectrum of a faint galaxy must be observed. Near the limit it is not always easy to recognize features in the spectrum of a galaxy nor to distinguish them with certainty from accidental groupings of photographic grains. This situation has led us to consider alternative methods by which redshifts beyond the present spectrographic range can be adequately estimated. There are, in fact, at least four magnitudes of unexplored territory between the spectrographic limit and the faintest galaxies detectable by direct photography, and it is now clear that observations within that territory will be vital to any definitive cosmological result. In addition, the high precision of spectrographic red- shifts is not needed; we can well afford to trade a factor 10 in precision for the opportunity of reaching galaxies at larger distances. The problem is now being explored with a photoelectric technique which has already yielded some significant results for galaxies with large redshifts. By means of the photon counter at Palomar, multicolor observations have been obtained for ten galaxies in five clusters, two of which have redshifts considerably greater than 0.2 C. These data are reduced to spectral-energy distribution curves E (X). The amounts by which these E (X) curves are shifted as a whole toward the red provide a measure of the redshifts, while the areas under them provide a measure of bolometric magnitudes without the need for K corrections. The curves also provide K corrections by which conventional two-color observations of additional galaxies can be reduced to the same bolometric system. The redshift procedure rests on two conditions: (i) these E (X) curves should be on a true scale of energy per unit wave length; (2) galaxies being compared must be intrinsically similar, that is, the differences between them must be due largely to their redshifts and not to a Stebbins-Whitford effect. Since Whitford now finds that there is no pronounced peculiarity out to Z = 0.2, and since evolutionary changes would tend to appear gradually rather than suddenly, we are probably quite safe until extremely large redshifts are reached. While redshift-magnitude considerations are based on mean E (X) curves for several galaxies in each cluster, the data for individual galaxies show that ellipticals are not all exactly alike and that those of low luminosity tend to have broader and flatter maxima than those of high luminosity. An unexpected result of this work is the high infrared point at I micron, suggesting that the E (N) curves may actually have a second hump out in the infrared. The bolometric magnitudes must all be adjusted for absorption as a function of galactic latitude, for absolute magnitude as determined by rank, and for the degree to which the outskirts of each galaxy were included in the diaphragm of the photometer. This last effect, which has tended in the past to introduce systematic errors with distance, was handled here by observing individual galaxies through a sequence of concentric diaphragms to obtain intensity profiles. The final result is a plot of the logarithms of the redshifts against corrected bolometric magnitudes, each cluster being represented by a single point. The present data extend all the way from the nearby Virgo cluster to Cluster 1448 whose redshift was found to be 120,000 km/sec (or z = 0.4), and the points all fall remarkably close to a straight line of slope 5. There is no clear indication that the points favor a bend in either direction. In a sense, the apparent linearity of this relation may be rather a coincidence, because it corresponds to a cosmological model which is only an intermediate case in a continuum of possible cases. While a small departure from linearity one way or the other cannot be excluded, the amount of curvature recently estimated by Humason, Mayall, and Sandage would definitely be at variance with the present results. In this connection, the following points should be mentioned: In the first place, the present photometric data are all photoelectric, whereas the critical parts of the earlier work were photographic. In the second place, the present material extends to roughly twice as large a redshift. In the third place, all of the earlier material can be recalibrated by means of the photoelectric data and added to the diagram; when this is done, the picture is not significantly altered. Robertson's formula for the redshift-magnitude relation has the form: ntboi = 5 log cz + 1.086 (I - q - 2\~{}Z + constant, where q is a parameter identifying the cosmological model and where \~{} is an omni-purpose term to accommodate evolutionary changes in the absolute magnitudes, evolutionary changes in the K correction (that is, a Stebbins-Whitford effect), and intergalactic obscuration. The values of these factors comprising M are presently not well known, but the available evidence suggests that \~{} is likely to be considerably less than unity. If \~{}\~{}o, the observed redshift-magnitude relation yields q\~{}+I. Values from, say, +0.524]to +1.5 fall within the presently acceptable range. These results indicate that the universe either is Euclidean or is mildly curved inward, that is, closed and finite. The Euclidean case q = +0.5 is represented by the Einstein-de Sitter model in which the expansion continues indefinitely. The closed models, q $\gt$ +0.5, represent the oscillating solution in which the expansion eventually halts at a finite radius and the universe then starts contracting. Strongly curved models, either inward or outward, would not be compatible with the present results, nor would the steady-state model of Hoyle, Bondi, and Gold. From the value of q and the associated value of k, we can compute the radius of the universe, the age of the universe, and the mean density of matter in it, on the assumption that the cosmological constant is zero. The formulae for these quantities are reviewed in a paper by Hoyle and Sandage in the August issue of Pub. A. S. P. If we adopt as expansion constant 150 km/sec per megaparsec, the Euclidean case yields the age 4.3 billion years and mean density 4.2 X 10-29 g/cm3, while the closed models yield smaller ages and larger densities. Although the present material would not be incompatible with a closed model as young as 2.6 billion years (radius = 1400 mpc, density = 12.7 X 10-29 g/cm3), other evidence tends to favor something closer to the Euclidean case.

  abstract      = {We present a new near-infrared imaging survey in the four CFHTLS deep fields: the WIRCam Deep Survey or ``WIRDS''. WIRDS comprises extremely deep, high quality (FWHM \~{} 0.6{\Prime}) J, H, and K$_{s}$ imaging covering a total effective area of 2.1 deg$^{2}$ and reaching AB 50\% completeness limits of {\ap} 24.5. We combine our images with the CFHTLS to create a unique eight-band ugrizJHK$_{S}$ photometric catalogues in the four CFHTLS deep fields; these four separate fields allow us to make a robust estimate of the effect of cosmic variance for all our measurements. We use these catalogues in combination with {\ap} 9800 spectroscopic redshifts to estimate precise photometric redshifts ({$\sigma$}$_{Δz/(1 + z)}$ {\lsim} 0.03 at i $\lt$ 25), galaxy types, star-formation rates and stellar masses for a unique sample of {\ap} 1.8 million galaxies. Our JHK$_{s}$ number counts are consistent with previous studies. We apply the ``BzK'' selection to our gzK filter set and find that the star forming BzK selection successfully selects 76\% of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 1.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5 in our photometric catalogue, based on our photometric redshift measurement. Similarly the passive BzK selection returns 52\% of the passive 1.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5 population identified in the photometric catalogue. We present the mass functions of the total galaxy population as a function of redshift up to z = 2 and present fits using double Schechter functions. A mass-dependent evolution of the mass function is seen with the numbers of galaxies with masses of M {\lsim} 10$^{10.75}$ still evolving at z {\lsim} 1, but galaxies of higher mass reaching their present day numbers by z \~{} 0.8-1. This is consistent with the present picture of downsizing in galaxy evolution. We compare our results with the predictions of the GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model and find that the simulations provide a relatively successful fit to the observed mass functions at intermediate masses (i.e. 10 {\lsim} log (M/M$_{⊙}$) {\lsim} 11). However, as is common with semi-analytical predictions of the mass function, the GALFORM results under-predict the mass function at low masses (i.e. log (M/M$_{⊙}$) {\lsim} 10), whilst the fit as a whole degrades beyondredshifts of z \~{} 1.2.

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m$\gt$\~{}1 M$_{solar}$ and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around m$_{c}$\~{}0.08 M$_{solar}$ and a variance in logarithmic mass {$\sigma$}\~{}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has m$_{c}$\~{}0.2 M$_{solar}$ and {$\sigma$}\~{}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, n$_{BD}$\~{}n$_{*}$\~{}0.1 pc$^{-3}$. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages $\gt$\~{}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, m$_{c}$\~{}0.2-0.3 M$_{solar}$, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \~{}1 M$_{solar}$. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.  The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

  abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5M$_{solar}$ and near 0.08M$_{solar}$. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices {$\alpha$} are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by {$\Delta$}{$\alpha$}\~{}0.5 between 0.1 and 1M$_{solar}$ than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto {\amp} Zoccali; Paresce {\amp} De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez {\amp} Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 {$\mu$}m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

In all three wave bands, L increases markedly with redshift. For a (q0 = 0.5, Omega = 1.0) cosmological model, the comoving luminosity density increases as (1 + z)2.1 +/- 0.5 at 1 mu m, as (1 + z)2.7 +/- 0.5 at 4400 A, and as (1 + z)3.9 +/- 0.75 at 2800 A, these exponents being reduced by 0.43 and 1.12 for (0.05, 0.1) and (-0.85, 0.1) cosmological models, respectively. The L ( lambda )- tau relation can be reasonably well modeled by an actively evolving stellar population with a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) extending to 125 M{\sun}, and a star formation rate declining as tau -2.5 with a turn-on of star formation at early epochs. A Scalo IMF extending to the same mass limit produces too many long-lived low-mass stars. This rapid evolution of the star formation rate and comoving luminosity density of the universe is in good agreement with the conclusions of Pei {\amp} Fall from their analysis of the evolving metallicity of the universe. One consequence of this evolution is that the physical luminosity density at short wavelengths has probably declined by 2 orders of magnitude since z \~{} 1.},

  abstract = {The Lyman decrement associated with the cumulative effect of HI in QSO absorption systems along the line of sight provides a distinctive feature for identifying galaxies at z$\gt$\~{}2.5. Colour criteria, which are sensitive to the presence of a Lyman continuum break superposed on an otherwise flat UV spectrum, have been shown, through Keck spectroscopy, to successfully identify a substantial population of star-forming galaxies at 3$\lt$\~{}z$\lt$\~{}3.5. Such objects have proven to be surprisingly elusive in field galaxy redshift surveys; quantification of their surface densities and morphologies is crucial for determining how and when galaxies formed. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations offer the opportunity to exploit the ubiquitous effect of intergalactic absorption and obtain useful statistical constraints on the redshift distribution of galaxies to considerably fainter limits than the current spectroscopic limits. We model the HI cosmic opacity as a function of redshift, including scattering in resonant lines of the Lyman series and Lyman continuum absorption, and use stellar population synthesis models with a wide variety of ages, metallicities, dust contents and redshifts to derive colour selection criteria that provide a robust separation between high-redshift and low-redshift galaxies. From the HDF images we construct a sample of star-forming galaxies at 2$\lt$\~{}z$\lt$\~{}4.5. While none of the \~{}60 objects in the HDF having known Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0$\lt$\~{}z$\lt$\~{}1.4 is found to contaminate our high-redshift sample, our colour criteria are able to efficiently select the 2.6$\lt$\~{}z$\lt$\~{}3.2 galaxies identified by Steidel et al. The ultraviolet (and blue) dropout technique opens up the possibility of investigating cosmic star and element formation in the early Universe. We set a lower limit to the ejection rate of heavy elements per unit comoving volume from Type II supernovae at $\lt$z$\gt$=2.75 of \~{}=3.6x10\^{}-4 M\_solar yr\^{}-1 Mpc\^{}-3 (for q\_0=0.5 and H\_0=50 km s\^{}-1 Mpc\^{}-1), which is 3 times higher than the local value but still 4 times lower than the rate observed at z\~{}=1. At $\lt$z$\gt$=4, our lower limit to the cosmic metal ejection rate is \~{}=3 times lower than the $\lt$z$\gt$=2.75 value. We discuss the implications of these results on models of galaxy formation, and on the chemical enrichment and ionization history of the intergalactic medium.},

  abstract = {We have detected likely z\~{}7-8 galaxies in the 144$^{''}${\times}144$^{''}$ Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Objects are required to be $\gt$=3 {$\sigma$} detections in both NICMOS bands, J$_{110}$ and H$_{160}$. The selection criteria for this sample are (z$_{850}$-J$_{110}$)$_{AB}$$\gt$0.8, (z$_{850}$-J$_{110}$)$_{AB}$$\gt$0.66(J$_{110}$-H$_{160}$)$_{AB}$+0.8, (J$_{110}$-H$_{160}$)$_{AB}$$\lt$1.2 and no detection at less than 8500 {\AA}. The five selected sources have total magnitudes H$_{160,AB}$\~{}27. Four of the five sources are quite blue compared to typical lower redshift dropout galaxies and are clustered within a 1 arcmin$^{2}$ region. Because all five sources are near the limit of the NICMOS data, we have carefully evaluated their reality. Each of the candidates is visible in different splits of the data and a median stack. We analyzed several noise images and estimate the number of spurious sources to be 1+/-1. A search using an independent reduction of this same data set clearly revealed three of the five candidates and weakly detected a fourth candidate, suggesting that the contamination could be higher. For comparison with predictions from lower redshift samples, we take a conservative approach and adopt four z\~{}7-8 galaxies as our sample. With the same detection criteria on simulated data sets, assuming no evolution from z\~{}3.8, we predict 10 sources at z\~{}7-8, or 14 if we use a more realistic (1+z)$^{-1}$ size scaling. We estimate that the rest-frame continuum UV (\~{}1800 {\AA}) luminosity density at z\~{}7.5 (integrated down to 0.3L$^{*}$$_{z=3}$) is just 0.20$^{+0.12}$$_{-0.08}$ times that found at z\~{}3.8 (or 0.20$^{+0.23}$$_{-0.12}$ times this quantity including cosmic variance). Effectively this sets an upper limit on the luminosity density down to 0.3L$^{*}$$_{z=3}$ and is consistent with significant evolution at the bright end of the luminosity function from z\~{}7.5 to 3.8. Even with the lower UV luminosity density at z\~{}7.5, it appears that galaxies could still play an important role in reionization at these redshifts, although definitive measurements remain to be made.

Using an i-z$\gt$1.4 cut, we find 30 i-dropouts over 21 arcmin$^{2}$ down to z$_{850,AB}$=28.1, or 1.4 i-dropouts arcmin$^{-2}$, with significant field-to-field variation (as expected from cosmic variance). This extends i-dropout searches some \~{}0.9 mag further down the luminosity function than was possible in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields, yielding a \~{}7 times increase in surface density. An estimate of the size evolution for UV-bright objects is obtained by comparing the composite radial flux profile of the bright i-dropouts (z$_{850,AB}$$\lt$27.2) with scaled versions of the Hubble Deep Field-North and -South U-dropouts. The best fit is found with a (1+z)$^{-1.57<SUP>+0.50}$$_{-0.53}$</SUP> scaling in size (for fixed luminosity), extending lower redshift (1$\lt$z$\lt$5) trends to z\~{}6. Adopting this scaling and the brighter i-dropouts from both GOODS fields, we make incompleteness estimates and construct a z\~{}6 luminosity function (LF) in the rest-frame continuum UV (\~{}1350 {\AA}) over a 3.5 mag baseline, finding a shape consistent with that found at lower redshift. To evaluate the evolution in the LF from z\~{}3.8, we make comparisons against different scalings of a lower redshift B-dropout sample. Although a strong degeneracy is found between luminosity and density evolution, our best-fit model scales as (1+z)$^{-2.8}$ in number and (1+z)$^{0.1}$ in luminosity, suggesting a rest-frame continuum UV luminosity density at z\~{}6 that is just 0.38$^{+0.09}$$_{-0.07}$ times that at z\~{}3.8. Our inclusion of the size evolution makes the present estimate lower than previous z\~{}6 estimates.

  abstract = {We determine the abundance of i'-band dropouts in the recently released HST/ACS Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF). Because the majority of these sources are likely to be z\~{} 6 galaxies whose flux decrement between the F775W i'-band and F850LP z'-band arises from Lyman-{$\alpha$} absorption, the number of detected candidates provides a valuable upper limit to the unextincted star formation rate at this redshift. We demonstrate that the increased depth of UDF enables us to reach an 8{$\sigma$} limiting magnitude of z'$_{AB}$= 28.5 (equivalent to 1.5h$^{-2}$$_{70}$M$_{solar}$yr$^{-1}$ at z= 6.1, or 0.1L$^{*}$$_{UV}$ for the z\~{} 3U-drop population), permitting us to address earlier ambiguities arising from the unobserved form of the luminosity function. We identify 54 galaxies (and only one star) at z'$_{AB}$ $\lt$ 28.5 with (i'-z')$_{AB}$ $\gt$ 1.3 over the deepest 11-arcmin$^{2}$ portion of the UDF. The characteristic luminosity (L$^{*}$) is consistent with values observed at z\~{} 3. The faint end slope ({$\alpha$}) is less well constrained, but is consistent with only modest evolution. The main change appears to be in the number density ({$\Phi$}*). Specifically, and regardless of possible contamination from cool stars and lower-redshift sources, the UDF data support our previous result that the star formation rate at z\~{} 6 was approximately six times less than at z\~{} 3. This declining comoving star formation rate [0.005h$_{70}$M$_{solar}$yr$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-3}$ at z\~{} 6 at L$_{UV}$ $\gt$ 0.1L$^{*}$ for a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF)] poses an interesting challenge for models which suggest that L$_{UV}$ $\gt$ 0.1L$^{*}$ star-forming galaxies at z\~{}= 6 reionized the Universe. The short-fall in ionizing photons might be alleviated by galaxies fainter than our limit, or a radically different IMF. Alternatively, the bulk of reionization might have occurred at z$\gt$$\gt$ 6.},

These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around \~{}10$^{10.8}$  $\{$M$\}$\_$\{$$\backslash$odot $\}$. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z $\lt$ 1, even among massive (gsim 10$^{11}$  $\{$M$\}$\_$\{$$\backslash$odot $\}$) quiescent galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density for star-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4. We construct a large, deep (K$_{s}$ $\lt$ 24) sample of 220 000 galaxies selected using the new UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our analysis is based on precise 30-band photometricredshifts. By comparing these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of {$\sigma$}$_{Δz/(1 + z)}$ = 0.008 at i$^{+}$ $\lt$ 22.5 and {$\sigma$}$_{Δz/(1 + z)}$ = 0.03 at 1.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4. We derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and star-forming populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a direct consequence of the star formation being ``quenched'' in galaxies more massive than {\phmmat} {\gsim} 10$^{10.7 - 10.9}${\phmmat}$_{⊙}$. For the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z $\lt$ 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. From z \~{} 3 to z \~{} 1, the density of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z \~{} 3 and z \~{} 1 and by less than 0.2 dex at z $\lt$ 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z $\lt$ 1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z $\gt$ 1.5 consistent with the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 10$^{10 - 10.5}${\phmmat}$_{⊙}$ galaxies increases continuously in the redshift range 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4. Finally, we compare our results with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced.

  abstract      = {We present measurements of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95,675 K$_{s}$ -selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50\%, 10\%, and 1\% of its current value at z \~{} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as {$\rho$}$_{star}$vprop(1 + z)$^{-4.7 ± 0.4}$ since z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as {$\rho$}$_{star}$vprop(1 + z)$^{-2.3 ± 0.2}$. At z $\gt$ 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the K$_{s}$ -selected star-forming galaxy SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4 show reasonable agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z $\gt$ 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(M $_{star}$/M $_{⊙}$) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with log(M $_{star}$/M $_{⊙}$) = 10.5 have grown by $\gt$1.0 dex since z = 2. At z $\lt$ 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.  Based on data products from observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under ESO programme ID 179.A-2005 and on data products produced by TERAPIX and the Cambridge Astronomy Survey Unit on behalf of the UltraVISTA consortium.},

  abstract      = {We present the discovery of six new quasars at z \~{} 6 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) southern survey, a deep imaging survey obtained by repeatedly scanning a stripe along the celestial equator. The six quasars are about 2 mag fainter than the luminous z \~{} 6 quasars found in the SDSS main survey and 1 mag fainter than the quasars reported in Paper I. Four of them comprise a complete flux-limited sample at 21 $\lt$ z $_{AB}$ $\lt$ 21.8 over an effective area of 195 deg$^{2}$. The other two quasars are fainter than z $_{AB}$ = 22 and are not part of the complete sample. The quasar luminosity function at z \~{} 6 is well described as a single power law {$\Phi$}(L $_{1450}$) vprop L $^{β}$ $_{1450}$ over the luminosity range -28 $\lt$ M $_{1450}$ $\lt$ -25. The best-fitting slope {$\beta$} varies from -2.6 to -3.1, depending on the quasar samples used, with a statistical error of 0.3-0.4. About 40\% of the quasars discovered in the SDSS southern survey have very narrow Ly{$\alpha$} emission lines, which may indicate small black hole masses and high Eddington luminosity ratios, and therefore short black hole growth timescales for these faint quasars at early epochs.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the photometric redshift accuracy achievable with the AKARI infrared data in deep multiband surveys, such as in the North Ecliptic Pole field. We demonstrate that the passage of redshifted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and silicate features into the mid-infrared wavelength window covered by AKARI is a valuable means to recover the redshifts of starburst galaxies. To this end, we have collected a sample of \~{}60 galaxies drawn from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North Field with spectroscopic redshift 0.5 $\lt$\~{} z$_{spec}$ $\lt$\~{} 1.5 and photometry from 3.6 to 24{$\mu$}m, provided by the Spitzer, Infrared Space Observatory and AKARI satellites. The infrared spectra are fitted using synthetic galaxy spectral energy distributions which account for starburst and active nuclei emission. For \~{}90 per cent of the sources in our sample, the redshift is recovered with an accuracy |z$_{phot}$ - z$_{spec}$|/(1 + z$_{spec}$) $\lt$\~{} 10 per cent. A similar analysis performed on a set of simulated spectra shows that the AKARI infrared data alone can provide photometric redshifts accurate to |z$_{phot}$ - z$_{spec}$|/(1 + z$_{spec}$) \~{} 10 per cent (1{$\sigma$}) at z $\lt$\~{} 2. At higher redshifts, the PAH features are shifted outside the wavelength range covered by AKARI and the photo-z estimates rely on the less prominent 1.6{$\mu$}m stellar bump; the accuracy achievable in this case on (1 + z) is \~{}10-15 per cent, provided that the active galactic nuclei contribution to the infrared emission is subdominant. Our technique is no more prone to redshift aliasing than optical-ultraviolet photo-z, and it may be possible to reduce this aliasing further with the addition of submillimetre and/or radio data.},

  abstract      = {Increasingly large samples of galaxies are now being discovered at redshifts z \~{} 5-6 and higher. Many of these objects are inferred to be young, low in mass, and relatively unreddened, but detailed analysis of their high quality spectra will not be possible until the advent of future facilities. In this paper, we shed light on the physical conditions in a plausibly similar low-mass galaxy by presenting the analysis of the rest-frame optical and UV spectra of Q2343-BX418, an L* galaxy at z = 2.3 with a very low mass-to-light ratio and unusual properties: BX418 is young ($\lt$100 Myr), low mass (M $_{sstarf}$ \~{} 10$^{9}$ M $_{sun}$), low in metallicity (Z \~{} 1/6 Z $_{sun}$), and unreddened (E(B - V) \~{}= 0.02, UV continuum slope {$\beta$} = -2.1). We infer a metallicity 12 + log(O/H) = 7.9 {\plusmn} 0.2 from the rest-frame optical emission lines. We also determine the metallicity via the direct, electron temperature method, using the ratio O III] {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}1661, 1666/[O III] {$\lambda$}5007 to determine the electron temperature and finding 12 + log(O/H) = 7.8 {\plusmn} 0.1. These measurements place BX418 among the most metal-poor galaxies observed in emission at high redshift. The rest-frame UV spectrum, which represents \~{}12 hr of integration with the Keck telescope, contains strong emission from Ly{$\alpha$} (with rest-frame equivalent width 54 {\AA}), He II {$\lambda$}1640 (both stellar and nebular), C III] {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}1907, 1909 and O III] {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}1661, 1666. The C IV/C III] ratio indicates that the source of ionization is unlikely to be an active galactic nucleus. Analysis of the He II, O III], and C III] line strengths indicates a very high ionization parameter log U \~{} -1, while Ly{$\alpha$} and the interstellar absorption lines indicate that outflowing gas is highly ionized over a wide range of velocities. It remains to be determined how many of BX418's unique spectral features are due to its global properties, such as low metallicity and dust extinction, and how many are indicative of a short-lived phase in the early evolution of an otherwise normal star-forming galaxy.  Based on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

Methods such as flux fitting, profile fitting, and PSF homogenization followed by matched-aperture photometry are all computationally expensive. We present an alternative solution called ``synthetic aperture photometry'' that exploits galaxy profile fits in one band to efficiently model the observed, point-spread-function-convolved light profile in other bands and predict the flux in arbitrarily sized apertures. Because aperture magnitudes are the most widely tabulated flux measurements in survey catalogs, producing synthetic aperture magnitudes (SYNMAGs) enables very fast matched photometry at the catalog level, without reprocessing imaging data. We make our code public and apply it to obtain matched photometry between Sloan Digital Sky Survey ugriz and UKIDSS YJHK imaging, recovering red-sequence colors and photometric redshifts with a scatter and accuracy as good as if not better than FWHM-homogenized photometry from the GAMA Survey. Finally, we list some specific measurements that upcoming surveys could make available to facilitate and ease the use of SYNMAGs.},

By combining the data from two complete sky coverage epochs in an advanced data processing system, AllWISE has generated new products that have enhanced photometric sensitivity and accuracy, and improved astrometric precision compared with the earlier WISE All-Sky Data Release.  Exploiting the 6 month baseline between the WISE sky coverage epochs enables AllWISE to measure source motions for the first time, and to compute improved flux variability statistics.  AllWISE data release products include: a Source Catalog that contains 4-band fluxes, positions, apparent motion measurements, and flux variability statistics for over 747 million objects detected at SNR$\gt$5 in the combined exposures; a Multiepoch Photometry Database containing over 42 billion time-tagged, single-exposure fluxes for each object detected on the combined exposures; and an Image Atlas of 18,240 4-band calibrated FITS images, depth-of-coverage and noise maps that cover the sky produced by coadding nearly 7.9 million single-exposure images from the cryogenic and post-cryogenic survey phases.  The Explanatory Supplement to the AllWISE Data Release Products is a general guide for users of the AllWISE data.  The Supplement contains detailed descriptions of the format and characteristics of the AllWISE data products, as well as a summary of cautionary notes that describe known limitations.  The Supplement is an on-line document that is updated frequently to provide the most current information for users of the AllWISE data products.
